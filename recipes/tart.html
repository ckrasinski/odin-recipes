        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            This incredibly easy, no-bake chocolate tart is made with a simple Oreo crust and rich chocolate ganache filling made with both milk and dark chocolates. You won’t be able to eat just one piece!
        </p>

        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>24 Oreo cookies</li>

            <li>6 tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, melted</li>

            <li>1 cup (170g, 6 oz.) coarsely chopped bittersweet chocolate</li>

            <li>1 cup (170g, 6 oz.) coarsely chopped milk chocolate</li>

            <li>1 cup (240 ml) heavy cream</li>

            <li>¼ cup (56g) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces</li>
        </ul>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Pulse Oreo cookies, with filling, in a food processor until finely ground.</li>

            <li>Transfer crumbs to a medium bowl, add melted butter, and mix until combined and moistened.</li>

            <li>Press the mixture onto the bottom and up the sides of a 9-inch (23cm) tart pan.</li>

            <li>Place it in the fridge for 30 minutes to firm up before adding the filling (or before baking the crust).</li>

            <li>In a medium heatproof bowl, place chopped bittersweet and milk chocolate.</li>

            <li>In a small saucepan over medium heat, bring the heavy cream and butter to a low boil.</li>

            <li>Remove from the heat and pour mixture over the chocolate.</li>

            <li>Let stand for 1 minute.</li>

            <li>Using a rubber spatula, stir mixture until melted and smooth (if not completely melted, heat in the microwave for several seconds and stir, until melted).</li>

            <li>Pour mixture over chilled Oreo crust and refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        </ol>
